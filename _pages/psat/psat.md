## Introduction

Standardized testing remains a metric of admission for most places of higher institutional learning. 

While the PSAT/NMSQT is not one of those metrics, it is a perfect sample of the SAT environment that students will go through if they choose to take the SAT for the purpose of college admissions. 

Not only that, but there also lies a chance to become selected for a [National Merit Scholarship](https://www.nationalmerit.org/s/1758/interior.aspx?sid=1758&gid=2&pgid=424) based on a students performance on the PSAT.

This curriculum, outlined by the objectives below, aims to help students learn vital test-taking and studying techniques that will help them not only perform well in the standardized PSAT but also learn techniques for operating in the dynamic academic environment, wherever they choose to go! 

## Objectives for Curriculum

* Learn test-taking techniques to maximize points scored under tight time deadline.
* Get introduced to the SAT test-taking environment and expectations.
* Structure a well-rounded and comprehensive knowledge base of all 3 tested subjects within the PSAT.

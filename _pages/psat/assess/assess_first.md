 > corner of her garden, she and her colleagues at Leiden  
 > University in the Netherlands placed a rodent running  
 > (LINE 5) wheel inside an open cage and trained a motion-detecting  
 > infrared camera on the scene. Then they put out a dish of  
 > food pellets and chocolate crumbs to attract animals to the  
 > wheel and waited.  
 > Wild house mice discovered the food in short order,  
 > (LINE 10) then scampered into the wheel and started to run. Rats,  
 > shrews, and even frogs found their way to the wheel—  
 > more than 200,000 animals over 3 years. The creatures  
 > seemed to relish the feeling of running without going  
 > anywhere.  
 > (LINE 15) The study “puts a nail in the coffin” of the debate over  
 > whether mice and rats will run on wheels in a natural  
 > setting, says Ted Garland, an evolutionary physiologist at  
 > the University of California, Riverside. More importantly,  
 > he says, the findings suggest that like (some) humans,

 > like to. Figuring out why certain strains of mice are more

 > differences between more active and sedentary people, he  
 > adds.  
 > (LINE 25) Even before Meijer got creative in her yard, researchers  
 > knew that captive mice are exercise maniacs. In  
 > laboratories and bedrooms, they frequently log more than  
 > 5 km per night on stationary running wheels. But  
 > scientists didn’t know why the animals did it.  
 > (LINE 30) One thing was clear: they seem to enjoy it. Mice find  
 > exercise rewarding; just as they can be trained to press a  
 > lever dozens of times to release a pellet of food, the  
 > rodents will go to great lengths to unlock a running wheel  
 > when it has a brake on, and get back to spinning, Garland  
 > (LINE 35) says. But is the drive to run normal, or is it an aberrant,  
 > obsessive behavior triggered by living in a shoebox-sized  
 > cage?  
 > Meijer’s work seems to have answered that question.  
 > On average, the backyard mice she and colleagues  
 > (LINE 40) observed ran in 1- to 2-minute stints, roughly the same  
 > duration as that seen in lab mice. The team also set up a  
 > second wheel in a nearby nature preserve of grassy dunes  
 > and attracted a similar crowd of enthusiasts. The animals  
 > kept running even when Meijer removed the food from  
 > (LINE 45) the garden site, although they came in smaller numbers,    
 > she notes. Sometimes the rodents were so eager to run    
 > that they couldn’t wait to take turns, she says: At    
 > one point, a large mouse sent a smaller mouse flying    
 > when it climbed on to the wheel and started running    
 > (LINE 50) in the opposite direction.      
 >   
 > The fact that the wild mice and other animals were    
 > bold enough to enter the cage and use the wheel is    
 > “very weird,” but perhaps not as surprising when one    
 > (LINE 55) considers that many domesticated animals also like to    
 > un on wheels, including dogs and chickens, says    
 > Justin Rhodes, a neuroscientist at the University of    
 > Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.    
 > (LINE 60) Although the common house mice observed in the    
 > study tend to be more leery of novel structures than    
 >  other species—an evolutionary adaptation to the    
 > human penchant for building mousetraps—Garland    
 > suggests that the wheel may provide a more secure

 > Twentieth-century psychologist Frederic Bartlett

 > In one test of that idea, an experimenter sat in a library  
 > and kept an eye on the copier. When someone approached  
 > it, the experimenter rushed up and tried to cut in front,  
 > (LINE 15) saying, “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox  
 > machine?” Unless the subject was making a great many  
 > more than five copies, the experimenter has provided no  
 > justification for the intrusion, so why yield? Apparently a

 > (LINE 20) subjects gave the equivalent of that answer, and refused.  
 > The obvious way to increase the likelihood of compliance is  
 > to offer a valid and compelling reason why someone should  
 > let you go first. And indeed, when the experimenter said,  
 > “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox  
 > (LINE 25) machine, because I’m in a rush?” the rate of refusals fell

 > assessing the reason and deciding it was a worthy one.  
 > (LINE 30) Maybe they were mindlessly—automatically—following a  
 > mental script.  
 > That script might go something like this: Someone asks  
 > a small favor with zero justification: say no; someone asks a  
 > small favor but offers a reason, any reason: say yes. The idea  
 > (LINE 35) is easy to test. Just walk up to people approaching a  
 > photocopier and to each of them say something like  
 > “Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox  
 > machine, because xxx,” where “xxx” is a phrase that, though  
 > parading as the reason for the request, really provides no  
 > (LINE 40) justification at all. The researchers chose as “xxx” the  
 > phrase “because I have to make some copies,” which merely  
 > states the obvious and does not offer a legitimate reason for  
 > butting in. If the people making copies consciously weighed  
 > this nonreason against their own needs, one would expect  
 > (LINE 45) them to refuse in the same proportion as in the case in    
 > which no reason was offered

 > reason was important enough to trigger the “yes”  
 > aspect of the script, regardless of the fact that the  
 > (LINE 50) excuse itself had no validity, only about 6 percent  
 > should refuse, as occurred in the case in which the  
 > reason provided—“I’m in a rush”—was compelling.  
 > And that’s exactly what the researchers found. When  
 > the experimenter said, “Excuse me, I have five pages.  
 > (LINE 55) May I use the Xerox machine, because I have to make  
 > some copies?” only 7 percent refused, virtually the

 > (LINE 60) In their research report, those who conducted this

 > with the aid of automatic scripts, performing others.

    * (C) amount of conscious attention that the subject gave to the experimenter's request.

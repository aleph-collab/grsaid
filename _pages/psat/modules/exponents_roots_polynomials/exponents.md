* We're familiar with multiplication right? 3 * 3, 4 * 5, so on and so forth.
* But how can we make this concept even more powerful? We use exponents! 
 * We place a tiny number (called the exponent) on the shoulders of a "base" number. Like so:
 > 2² = 2 * 2
 * This creates repeated multiplication of the base number! An efficient way to write out a long line of multiplcation:
 > 3⁵ = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3
 * We can also use exponents for variables or special constants:
 > x² = x * x  
 > π² = π * π

* What happens when we multiply exponents together? Is there any way we can simplify this?
  * Different bases:
  > 5² * 2⁵ 
  * What about when bases are the same? Is there an easier way to write this?
  > 5² * 5⁵   
  > (5 * 5) * (5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5)  
  > 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5    
  > 5⁷  
  * Interesting, so `5² * 5⁵ = 5⁷`. Do you notice what happened to the exponents?
  * This is the *addition rule* of exponents, when multiplying an exponent of similiar bases we can simply add the exponents together.
  * Does this apply to variables?
  > x² * x⁵   
  > (x * x) * (x * x * x * x * x)  
  > x * x * x * x * x * x * x    
  > x⁷  
  * Still works!

* What happens when we divide exponents? Is there any way we can simplify this?
  * Keep in  mind that we can **cancel** out numbers when dividing, even when they are being multiplied by another number.
  > (7 * 5) / 5  
  > 7  
  * We can verify this by solving!
  > (7 * 5) / 5  
  > 35 / 5  
  > 7 (Same answer!)   
  * Keep in mind this does not work when adding or subtracting numbers in the numerator or the denominator.
  > (7 + 5) / 5  
  > 12 / 5 != 7  
  * So when dividing exponents of similiar bases:
  > 5⁵ / 5²   
  > (5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5) / (5 * 5)
  > 5 * 5 * 5  
  > 5³ 
  * Interesting, so `5⁵ / 5² = 5³`. Do you notice what happened to the exponents?
  * This is the *subtraction rule* of exponents, when dividing exponents of similiar bases we can simply subtract the exponents.
  * Does this apply to variables?
  > x⁵ / x²   
  > (x * x * x * x * x) / (x * x)  
  > x * x * x   
  > x³    
  * Still works!

* And lastly, what occurs when there is an exponent outside of parantheses of a term that already contains an exponent?
  > (5²)⁵     
  > (5 * 5) * (5 * 5) * (5 * 5) * (5 * 5) * (5 * 5)  
  * How many 5's do we see here? 
  * Interesting, so `(5²)⁵ = 5¹⁰`. Do you notice what happened to the exponents?
  * This is the *multiplication rule* of exponents, when there exists an exponent above another exponent, we can simply multiply these two together!
  * Does this apply to variables?
  > (x²)⁵    
  > ...  
  * Still works!
  * And lastly, does it apply to terms that contain multiple variables or constants combined via multiplication or division? 
  > (y³x²)⁵
  > (y³/x²)⁵
  * Let's figure this out...
  * But does this work for terms combined with addition or subtraction?
  > (y³ + x²)⁵
  > (y³ - x²)⁵

## Exponents Practice
 
1. Evaluate `2³`

2. Evaluate `1¹⁰`

3. Evaluate `5² * 5³ * 5⁵` 

4. Evaluate `(5² * 5³) / 5⁵` 

5. Evaluate `(x⁷ * x³ * 5⁵) / x⁵` 

6. Evaluate `(y⁷ * x³ * x⁵) / x⁵` 

7. Evaluate `(2³)¹⁰`

8. Evaluate `(x³)⁵ / x⁵` 

9. Evaluate `(x²y²)²`

10. Evaluate `50x⁶y²z / 5x⁴`

## Negative Exponents

* First off what are negative exponents?
  > 2⁻⁵  
  * Let's consider, if `2⁵` tells you to multiply 2 by itself 5 times, and negative is opposite of positive, then what must be the opposite of multiplication?
  > 2⁻⁵  -> 1 / (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2) -> 1 / 2⁵  
  * i.e. divide by 2 five times
  * therefore negative exponents is simply repeated division
  * Applicable to exponents as well
  > x⁻⁵  -> 1 / (x * x * x * x * x) -> 1 / x⁵

* All these rules discussed above should also apply to negative exponents as well! 

## Negative Exponents Practice

1. Evaluate `x² * x⁻⁵`

2. Evaluate `x² / x⁻⁵`

3. Evaluate `(x⁻⁵)³`

4. Evaluate `(x⁻⁵)⁻³`
 
## Solving Exponents

* We can use similiar bases when attempting to solve for a variable that is in the exponent. 
  * Let's consider
  > 3ˣ = 3⁵
  * What is the value of *x* in this case? No trick questions involved! 
  * This means that we can extend this to mean
  > x = 5  
  * This is great! This means we can solve **any** exponent problem that contains similiar bases!
  > 2⁽ˣ⁺⁵⁾ = 2⁷  
  > (x+5) = 7  
  * But what about when it seems like the bases are **not** the same
    > 2⁽ˣ⁺⁵⁾ = 32  
    * Well let's consider, can 32 be expressed as an exponent of 2?
    * Yes it indeed can!
    > 2⁽ˣ⁺⁵⁾ = 2⁵
    * Now we are back to our initial problem of solving for x:
    > x + 5 = 5  
  * In fact, perhaps we can apply this transformation of different bases to the other rules we discussed? Involves a little creative flexibility...

## Rules re-visited

1. Express `5² * 25` as an exponent with a base of `5`.

2. Express `5⁴ / 25` as an exponent with a base of `5`.

3. Express `3⁴ * 9` as an exponent with a base of `3`.

4. Express `3² / 27` as an exponent with a base of `3`.

## Solving Exponents Problems

1. Solve `3⁽⁴ˣ⁺⁶⁾ = 27²ˣ`

2. Solve `5³ˣ⁻² = 125²ˣ`

3. Solve `36ˣ = 216ˣ⁻³`

* So we went over the addition rule, the subtraction rule, and the division rule, but does there exist any further rules?
  * There is the "division rule" which is really just **roots** coming up next. 

Keep up the hard work!

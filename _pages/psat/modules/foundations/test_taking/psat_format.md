# PSAT Format

* The PSAT is a timed exam, so even if you had perfect knowledge and capability to answer each question to the best of your knowledge, you are still limited without a "good plan of attack."
  * This is where "test-taking-skills" come around.

* First lets take a look at the format
  * No penalties for wrong answers (not how it was for me when I took it!)
  * 2 hours and 45 mins
    * 60 mins for reading (47 questions)
    * 35 mins for writing (44 questions)
    * 70 mins for math (48 questions)
  * Scored 320 - 1520
    * 760 for English and Writing
    * 760 for Math
    * (when it comes to the SAT you can take the test multiple times and aim for performance in specific sections, no reason to do that for the PSAT however)
  * Questions vary in difficulty. Before it used to be: easy questions go first, and hard questions go last, so a viable strategy would be to quickly answer first easy questions and spend more quality time as you get to the end of the section. 
    * However, that appears to no longer be true! Now they are randomized.
    * Remember easy questions are worth the same as hard questions. So how can we use this to our advantage (never play fair!)

## Strategies

* For all sections:
  * For questions that are clear-cut, proceed with figuring them out and answering.
  * For questions, that are hard with no obvious solution, skip but indicate that you will come back to it via a demarcation (for example, a star).
  * Once you have completed all the easier questions, circle-back to your blank choices and attempt to solve.
  * If you run out of time, circle in a random choice! Or if it is an open-response, choose the question number as the answer.
* For the reading sections:
  * Read the questions first and then cirle-back the passage, only focusing on key-information!
* The best way to figure out your own test-taking strategy however is to keep taking practice tests. Therefore, this course will be dotted by practice exams once every few modules!

## Guessing

* Guess if and only if you do not have any time left! Here is where guessing lies on a scale of things to do on the PSAT:
  1. Attempt to answer question.
  2. Skip question, but come back to later.
  3. Guess. <-- You are here!
  4. Leave blank. (never do this!)

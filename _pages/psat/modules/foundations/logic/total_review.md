> investors usually don't put all their eggs into one basket. Diversification also occurs when we  
> buy consumer goods. In that domain, however, diversification isn't always the most advantageous  
> strategy. Have you ever opted for variety in purchasing a month's supply of breakfast cereal, only  
> to later regret not having chosen more boxes of your favorite cereal?  
> ...   
> The simple takeaway for savvy consumers: if you want to choose optimally, make your choices on an  
> as-needed basis. If that's not practical, don't over-diversify if there are significant intervals  
> between consumption. One of the remaining questions, then, is this: how do the laboratory findings  
> on consumption spacing translate into real life? For example, how many hours, days or weeks make  
> for a meaningful gap that would prevent the average consumer from growing tired of eating the same  
> cereal? For individual consumers, only experience will tell.

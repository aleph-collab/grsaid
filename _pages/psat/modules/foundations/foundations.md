# Foundations 

## Logic

Underlying all 3 PSAT sections is the implicit requirement of logic. In fact, underlying all human studies is also the implicit requirement of logic. Learning this field of mathematics will help in all future studies, as it will contextualize the "acquisition of knowledge." That is, you will understand the basis and system of the language of academia.

For example, if someone says "If it rains, I will wear a jacket" and they assert it is true, what other truths can we parse?

Let us think of a few:

A) "If I do not wear a jacket, it is not raining."

B) "If it does not rain, I will not wear a jacket."

C) "It is not raining, or I will wear a jacket."

Can you parse which one of these are still true, given that "If it rains, I will wear a jacket" is true?

It actually turns out, that "B" is the false statement here. And even if we abstract away all thoughts of rules and theorems and proofs, we can even almost "feel" that "B" is false. Just because it is not raining, doesn't mean maybe I'd want to wear a jacket, maybe I recently got a jacket as a Christmas present and I'm feeling particularly stylish so I decide to adorn the jacket, regardless if it rains or not. 

Fashion aside, we see this type of language in ALL fields of practice and learned skills. 

Law:
    "If you pay me $10, I will make you a bracelet."
    Leads to "You did not make me a bracelet, you do not get $10."

Math:
    "If x is an even number, 3x is also an even number."
    Can lead to "3x is an odd number, then x is an odd number."

Software Engineering:
    "If you provide your name and birthday date, siri will wish you happy birthday."
    Can lead to "Siri did not wish you a happy birthday, you did not provide your name and date."
    OR maybe, you did provide your name and date and yet Siri did not provide any well wishes! This indicates
    that maybe Siri herself did not uphold her contract OR there is a hidden conditional that we have yet to find!

And most importantly for our purposes, appears in the PSAT:

    "According to the passage, diversification bias is most likely to occur when consumers..."

    This is a prompt to the conditional "q when p" where "q" is "diversifcation bias is most likely to occur" and we have to select for the correct "p". 

    x <= 5
    2x + y >= 10

    If y = 6, which of the following represents all values of *x* which satisfies the systems of equations above.

    This is an AND statement where we have to find the proper range of values that ensures BOTH sentences are true!

Therefore, we will spend 1 week at most on logic to get some basic rules down, and revisit it as we explore the PSAT further. 

## Test-Taking

The PSAT, while encompassing a well-rounded representation of knowledge, is still just a standardized test.

Therefore even if a student could answer every single question correctly, it still does not stipulate a perfect score. To get a perfect score, one must figure out a strategy to take the test to answer each question correctly in the limited time available.

One such method is to answer hard questions first and then complete easy questions. However, more conservative test-takers will prefer to answer questions in order.

Regardless of preference, some strategies are applicable to all test-takers! For example, the PSAT does not penalize for wrong answers, so it would be best to always fill in an answer even if unsure! If time allows, the student could then go back to this question and attempt to solve again.

## Vocabulary

Lastly, a good grasp of of the English vocabulary would be a positive asset when taking the test. This could either be acquired passively or actively given time-constraints. If the test is within 3 months or less, it would be best for a student to review a list of college-level vocabulary words weekly to expand their use of language and answer questions with confidence.

In addition, an expanded vocabulary will only be a boon to a student when it comes time to write essays, whether for personal reasons or in standardized testing.

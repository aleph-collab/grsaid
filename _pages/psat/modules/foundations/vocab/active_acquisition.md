title: Active Acquisiton of Vocab Words
---


* In the active method of vocab acquisition, these 30 minutes should be spent reading but rather studying a dedicated list of words. Aim for 15 new words each day. (rote memory)
  * Set a timer for 30 minutes
  * Memorize the definitions of each word, 5 at-a-time. When you are able to recite the defintions of the words without looking, you can proceed to the next. 
  * Each time you proceed to the next, recite the definition of all words that you previously went over for that day.

* See "vocab_active.csv"!

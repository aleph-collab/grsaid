  * For the PSAT, it is recommended to passively acquire new vocabulary words through natural means, like reading articles, books, or any other form of literature (as long as it contains words that you do not recognize!)
  * On the other hand, during the SAT, is generally recommended to work through a list of SAT vocabulary words.

* Not only does it help with the PSAT & SAT, but it will only assist you get ideas across, which is something you want to be able to do in any situation in life

* In the passive method of vocab acquisition, as little as 30 mins each day will help with this expansion.
  * Set a timer for 10 minutes
  * Keep a notebook, piece of paper, or computer open next to you to record a word you're unfamiliar with and then look up its definition.

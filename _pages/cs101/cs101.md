## Introduction

Computer science is an amalgamation of mathematics, linguistics, programming and other fields even ranging to library science (thank your librarian!).

For this course however, we will learn the C programming language and how it can be used to create correct programs with expected behavior. 

We will explore basics of programming languages that students can take to any other programming language, briefly explore the underlying mechanics of the computer that allow it to work, and create interesting projects that satisfy a students not only academic but creative endeavors. 

If the oppurtunity allows, we also pair students up to complete projects together to get a head-start on collaborative programming. 

## Objectives for Curriculum

* Understand what a program is, and how it can be written to achieve a goal.
* Learn the fundementals of algorithms and data-structures in the context of the C-programming language.
* Learn how to collaboratively create programming projects in a team of different backgrounds and skill-level.
